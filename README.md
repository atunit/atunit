# Welcome to the ATUnit Project

So you probably want to go to the [issues list](https://github.com/atunit/atunit/issues)! The issues list is basically a discussion board of what needs to happen. If you are logged into GitHub you can hit *Watch* (near the top right of the screen) to get updates on new issues. One will probably pop up that you can help with!

We are building a welcoming and sustainable funding community. This is largely a response to the [Gittip crisis](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Gittip_crisis).
